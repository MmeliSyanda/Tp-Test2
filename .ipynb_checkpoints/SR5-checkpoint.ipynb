    "Explanation of Linear Search Algorithm\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "Best Case: O(1)\n",
    "In the best-case scenario, the target element is found at the beginning of the dataset in the first comparison.\n",
    "Therefore, the time complexity is constant, denoted as O(1).\n",
    "Worst Case: O(n)\n",
    "In the worst-case scenario, linear search performs n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the dataset.\n",
    "This occurs when the target element is not present in the dataset or is located at the end of the dataset.\n",
    "Therefore, the time complexity is linear, denoted as O(n).\n",
    "Average Case: O(n)\n",
    "Linear search also exhibits linear time complexity on average, as it may need to iterate through a significant portion of the dataset to find the target element.\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "Linear search has a space complexity of O(1).\n",
    "It does not require any additional space proportional to the size of the dataset.\n",
    "Linear search operates on the dataset in place without requiring any additional data structures.\n",
    "Efficiency Analysis:\n",
    "Linear search is straightforward to implement and does not require the dataset to be sorted.\n",
    "However, its time complexity grows linearly with the size of the dataset, making it inefficient for large datasets.\n",
    "In contrast to binary search, linear search does not take advantage of the dataset's sorted order to optimize the search process.\n",
    "With only O(1) space complexity, linear search is memory efficient and suitable for memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "In summary, linear search is a simple algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1). While it is not as efficient as binary search for large datasets, it is suitable for small datasets or situations where the dataset is not sorted."
